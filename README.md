on modern, minimalistic design. Feel free to explore the results at:

https://prestige-demo.zoralab.com/




## Why Such Project?
Some good reasons:

1. **Making Sure We Deliver What We Promised** - live-tested product and proven
   reliable for working with us as a business partner.
2. **Pushing [ZORALab's Hestia](https://hestia.zoralab.com) to expand its GUI
   design capabilities** - can't expect everything to use 1 UI art direction and
   style.
3. **Explore How Maintainable ZORALab's Hestia can be** - for data gathering and
   present it to our client.
